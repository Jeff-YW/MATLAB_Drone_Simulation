Readme.For question 1:Run ‘quadcopter_script_q12.m’ and the simulation should work. Uncomment the MATLAB code for Drone_q1.m, and comment out the MATLAB code for Drone_q2.m

For question 2:Run ‘quadcopter_script_q12.m’ and the simulation should work. Uncomment the MATLAB code for Drone_q2.m, and comment out the MATLAB code for Drone_q1.mFor question 3a: Run ‘quadcopter_script_q3ab.m’ and the simulation should work. Uncomment the MATLAB code for Drone_q3a.m, and comment out the MATLAB code for Drone_q3b.m

For question 3b: 
Run ‘quadcopter_script_q3ab.m’ and the simulation should work. Uncomment the MATLAB code for Drone_q3b.m, and comment out the MATLAB code for Drone_q3a.m

Note: for question 2, the supporting MATLAB file is q2a_linear_model_generation.m, which is used to generate the state space linear matrix. It is already saved as disc_sys.mat file and can be directly loaded in question2. 

for question 3, the supporting MATLAB file is q3_ss_controller.m, which is used to generate the state space controller matrix. It is already saved as ss_controller_matrix.mat file and can be directly loaded in question3.
