# MATLAB Drone Simulation README

This README outlines the goals and execution instructions for various simulation questions related to quadcopter dynamics and control.

- **Question 1:** Focuses on simulating a quadcopter using a non-linear model to observe behavior under different propeller speeds. Run "quadcopter_script_q12.m" and ensure the code for "Drone_q1.m" is active while "Drone_q2.m" is commented out.

- **Question 2:** Compares a linearized model of the quadcopter's dynamics against the non-linear model to understand the implications of linear approximation. Use "quadcopter_script_q12.m" with "Drone_q2.m" code uncommented and "Drone_q1.m" commented out. The linear model is prepared with "q2a_linear_model_generation.m" and saved in "disc_sys.mat".

- **Question 3a & 3b:** Implement feedback control for trajectory following, first with perfect sensors and then considering sensor noise. Run "quadcopter_script_q3ab.m" for each part, toggling between "Drone_q3a.m" and "Drone_q3b.m" as appropriate. The control matrix is generated by "q3_ss_controller.m" and saved in "ss_controller_matrix.mat".

Each question targets specific learning objectives related to quadcopter control and simulation, from understanding basic dynamics to advanced control in the presence of noise.
